# Music-recommender

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate the implementation of a Music Recommender System using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

## Overview

A Music Recommender System is designed to suggest music to users based on their listening history and preferences. The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is used to find similar users and recommend music that those similar users have enjoyed.
